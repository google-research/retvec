# RetVect: Resilient & Efficient Text Vectorizer


## Overview
RetVec is a next-gen text vectorizer designed to offer built-in adversarial resilience using robust word embeddings.

RetVec is trained to be resilient against character manipulations including insertion, deletion, typos, homoglyphs, LEET substitution, and more. The RetVec model is trained on top of a novel character embedding which can encode all UTF-8 characters and words. Thus, RetVec works out-of-the-box on over 100 languages without the need for a lookup table or fixed vocabulary size. Furthermore, RetVec is a layer, which means that it can be inserted into any TF model without the need for a separate pre-processing step.


### Getting started

#### Installation

You can use pip to install the TensorFlow version of RetVec:

```python
pip install tensorflow-retvec
```

RetVec has been tested on TensorFlow 2.6+ and python 3.7+.

### Basic Usage

`train_rewnet.py` is the REWNet training script. Example usage:

```python
cli/train_rewnet.py --train_config <train_config_path> --model_config <model_config_path> --output_dir <output_path>
```

Configurations for our base models are under the `configs/` folder.
